👋🏻 Hi, I’m Olivia!

💡 I’m interested in front-end development and UX/UI design

👩🏻‍💻 I'm currently working on:

- Contributing to the open-source Book Project. I've been coding in the React frontend and working on redesigning the web app UI. I also created their logo—check out the logo and a preview of the UI <a href="https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project/tree/0.2.0">here</a>!
- Migrating my CMS portfolio site to a static site in Gatsby

✉️ I'd love to hear from you! Reach out to ofvoler (at) gmail dot com
