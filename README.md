👋🏻 Hi, I’m Olivia!

💡 I’m interested in front-end development and UX/UI design.

👩🏻‍💻 I'm working on small projects in Figma, as well as contributing to the open-source Book Project. I've been coding in the React frontend and working on redesigning the web app UI. I also created their logo—<a href="https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project">check it out</a>!

✉️ I'd love to hear from you! Reach out to ofvoler (at) gmail dot com
